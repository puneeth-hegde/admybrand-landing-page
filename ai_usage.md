# AI Usage Report

## AI Tools Used
- **Primary tools:**
  - **ChatGPT (GPT-4.1)**: For architecture planning, debugging, and optimization.
  - **v0.dev**: For UI component generation (Hero, Features, Pricing, FAQ, Footer).
  - **GitHub Copilot**: For inline code completions and speedier development.

- **Key use cases:**
  - **UI Design & Component Generation:** Created Hero Section, Features, Pricing Cards, Testimonials Carousel, and FAQ components following 2025 SaaS trends.
  - **Styling & Animations:** Implemented glassmorphism, gradient overlays, dark mode, and GSAP/Framer Motion animations.
  - **Optimization:** Improved Lighthouse score (image optimization, code splitting).
  - **Debugging:** Fixed module resolution errors (framer-motion, critters) during Vercel deployment.
